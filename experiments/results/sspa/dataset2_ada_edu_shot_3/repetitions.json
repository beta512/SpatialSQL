If you have access to the database, you might use a query like the following to find the SRID, assuming the database supports such a query: SELECT SRID(location) FROM universities LIMIT 1 This query attempts to retrieve the SRID of the spatial data in the 'location' column from the first row of the 'universities' table. Note that the function name and availability can vary depending on the specific spatial database system in use (e.g., PostGIS, SpatiaLite).",

Typically, SRID information is stored in the metadata of the spatial columns or can be set during the creation of the table. However, since the schema does not specify this, you would need to check the database's spatial_ref_sys table or the documentation/configuration of the database to find the SRID used for the 'location' column in the 'universities' table.
