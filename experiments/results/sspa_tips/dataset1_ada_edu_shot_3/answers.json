In spatial databases, the SRID is crucial for interpreting the coordinates of geometries correctly, but it must be defined or mentioned in the table schema, documentation, or queried directly from the database if supported. In standard practice with SpatiaLite, if the SRID is not specified in the table creation or geometry insertion, it might default to a common SRID such as 4326 (WGS 84). However, without explicit information or access to the database metadata, I cannot provide a definitive answer. You might need to check the database metadata or configuration for this detail. Here's a general SQL query to check SRID in SpatiaLite, but it requires access to the geometry_columns table or similar metadata: SELECT srid FROM geometry_columns WHERE f_table_name = 'universities' This query assumes that the database maintains a 'geometry_columns' table that records metadata about the geometries used in the database, which is common in spatial databases like SpatiaLite."
