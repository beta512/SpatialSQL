The SRID is not explicitly mentioned in the table definitions. Typically, the SRID is defined when creating the geometry columns or can be set or altered using specific spatial functions or metadata tables in a spatial database. However, since this information is not provided in the schema, one would need to query the database's metadata or configuration to find out the SRID used for the 'location' column in the 'universities' table. If you have access to the database, you could use a query like the following to find the SRID (assuming the database supports such metadata queries, which is common in spatial databases like PostGIS but not directly shown for SpatiaLite in your schema): SELECT srid FROM geometry_columns WHERE f_table_name = 'universities' AND f_geometry_column = 'location' Without database access or additional metadata, the SRID cannot be determined from the given information."
